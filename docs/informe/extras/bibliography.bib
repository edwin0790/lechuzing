They are foreseen to equip several vertex detectors and beam telescopes. Most applications require high read-out speed, which imposes sensors to feature digital output with integrated zero suppression. The most recent development of MAPS at IPHC and IRFU addressing this issue will be reviewed. The design architecture, combining pixel array, column-level discriminators and zero suppression circuits, will be presented. Each pixel features a preamplifier and a correlated double sampling (CDS) micro-circuit reducing the temporal and fixed pattern noises. The sensor is fully programmable and can be monitored.

@article{Baudot2009,
	abstract = {The MIMOSA pixel sensors developed in Strasbourg have demonstrated attractive features for the detection of charged particles in high energy physics. So far, full-size sensors have been prototyped only with analog readout, which limits the output rate to about 1000 frames/second. The new MIMOSA 26 sensor provides a 2.2 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} sensitive surface with an improved readout speed of 10,000 frames/second and data throughput compression. It incorporates pixel output discrimination for binary readout and zero suppression micro-circuits at the sensor periphery to stream only fired pixel out. The sensor is back from foundry since february 2009 and has being characterized in laboratory and in test beam. The temporal noise is measured around 13-14 e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and an operation point corresponding to an efficiency of 99.5±0.1 {\%} for a fake rate of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} per pixel can be reached at room temperature. MIMOSA 26 equips the final version of the EUDET beam telescope and prefigures the architecture of monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) for coming vertex detectors (STAR, CBM and ILC experiments) which have higher requirements. Developments in the architecture and technology of the sensors are ongoing and should allow to match the desired readout speed and radiation tolerance. Finally, the integration of MAPS into a micro-vertex detector is addressed. A prototype ladder equipped, on both sides, with a row of 6 MIMOSA 26-like sensors is under study, aiming for a total material budget about 0.3{\%} X{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}.},

The feasibility of the neutron detection technique implemented in this work has been experimentally demonstrated. A thermal neutron detection efficiency of 11.3{\%} has been experimentally obtained with a conversion layer of 11.6 $\mu$m. It was experimentally verified that the thermal neutron detection efficiency of this technique is independent on the intensity of the incident thermal neutron flux, which was confirmed for conversion layers of different thicknesses. Based on the experimental results, a spatial resolution better than 25 $\mu$m is expected. This spatial resolution makes the proposed technique specially useful for neutron beam characterization, neutron beam dosimetry, high resolution neutron imaging, and several neutron scattering techniques.},

@phdthesis{Riihonen2015,
	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
