Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signaling rate is limited to 35 MB/s or 280 Mbit/s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB},

abstract = {This paper introduces a streak tube imaging lidar (STIL) used for real-time 3D range imaging. Based on the LabVIEW platform, this system realized system control, image acquisition, data processing and image display through PC. Long distance target imaging experiments have been carried out with our self-designed system. The frame rate of raw image processing is up to 100 Hz, and the real-time display of the intensity image and range image is realized. For a specific target with a distance of 2000 m away, the experimental results show that our system has realized spatial resolution up to 0.1 m and the range resolution up to 0.18 m, which can be further improved. Compared with the traditional STIL system using FPGA, DSP and other hardware control and processing methods, our system has the advantages of short design cycle, low cost and high flexibility.},
