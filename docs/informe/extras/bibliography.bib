They are foreseen to equip several vertex detectors and beam telescopes. Most applications require high read-out speed, which imposes sensors to feature digital output with integrated zero suppression. The most recent development of MAPS at IPHC and IRFU addressing this issue will be reviewed. The design architecture, combining pixel array, column-level discriminators and zero suppression circuits, will be presented. Each pixel features a preamplifier and a correlated double sampling (CDS) micro-circuit reducing the temporal and fixed pattern noises. The sensor is fully programmable and can be monitored. It will equip experimental apparatus starting data taking in 2009/2010. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

@article{Baudot2009,
	abstract = {The MIMOSA pixel sensors developed in Strasbourg have demonstrated attractive features for the detection of charged particles in high energy physics. So far, full-size sensors have been prototyped only with analog readout, which limits the output rate to about 1000 frames/second. The new MIMOSA 26 sensor provides a 2.2 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} sensitive surface with an improved readout speed of 10,000 frames/second and data throughput compression. It incorporates pixel output discrimination for binary readout and zero suppression micro-circuits at the sensor periphery to stream only fired pixel out. The sensor is back from foundry since february 2009 and has being characterized in laboratory and in test beam. The temporal noise is measured around 13-14 e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and an operation point corresponding to an efficiency of 99.5±0.1 {\%} for a fake rate of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} per pixel can be reached at room temperature. MIMOSA 26 equips the final version of the EUDET beam telescope and prefigures the architecture of monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) for coming vertex detectors (STAR, CBM and ILC experiments) which have higher requirements. Developments in the architecture and technology of the sensors are ongoing and should allow to match the desired readout speed and radiation tolerance. Finally, the integration of MAPS into a micro-vertex detector is addressed. A prototype ladder equipped, on both sides, with a row of 6 MIMOSA 26-like sensors is under study, aiming for a total material budget about 0.3{\%} X{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}.},
