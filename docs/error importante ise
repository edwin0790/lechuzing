ERROR:Place:1205 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <pll/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <clk_out_OBUF>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: clk_out.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. Although the net
   may still not route, you will be able to analyze the failure in FPGA_Editor.
   < PIN "pll/clkout1_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
