WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net curr_state_FSM_FFd5-In1 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

    Number used as logic:                      127 out of   5,720    2%
      Number using O6 output only:              75
      Number using O5 output only:               1

      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    44 out of   1,430    3%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        48 out of   2,860    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          129
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            55 out of     129   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of     129    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          72 out of     129   55%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
